# Odin Sign-Up Form Mobile Project

## ÔøΩ Overview

This is a mobile adaptation of the sign-up form project from **The Odin Project** curriculum. Originally built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this version demonstrates React Native development using Expo, showcasing mobile UI design patterns, form validation, and cross-platform development.

This mobile app is part of a continuous journey and collection of authentication pages, each built using different technologies. This version explores mobile development with React Native and Expo, following the same design principles as the web version.

The mobile app includes:
- A full-screen background image with overlay.
- Mobile-optimized sign-up form with native inputs.
- Real-time password validation with visual feedback.
- Responsive design for both iOS and Android platforms.
